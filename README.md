## Project Overview

This project was inspired by my wifeâ€™s experience during her first days after moving to Switzerland. She faced the challenge of browsing the internet to find budget-friendly places to visit. Budget Explorer aims to alleviate this struggle for anyone moving to a new country or simply looking to explore their surroundings on a budget. We hope it helps users connect with their new environment and find joy in discovering affordable adventures.

### HTTPS Warnings Explanation

- **Best Practices**:

  - **Trust and Safety**: The Lighthouse report showed 7 insecure requests related to Cloudinary URLs.
  - **Reason**: Cloudinary hosts our media files, and during development, some images might be uploaded via HTTP. These requests are automatically upgraded to HTTPS by Cloudinary. However, Lighthouse still flags these as issues.
  - **Production Environment**: In our production environment, all media files are uploaded and served over HTTPS. Despite this, the warnings persisted in the Lighthouse report, affecting the best practices score.
  - **Resolution**: To address this, I ensured that all media uploads in the development and production environments are performed over HTTPS. As an admin should be aware of this when uploading media through the admin panel in the development environment.
  - **Impact**: These warnings do not affect the security of our application in production but are noted to explain the lower score in the best practices category.

  ### Known Bugs

- **Email Verification 500 Server Error**:
  - **Description**: During the registration process, users receive a confirmation email from our email provider, Mailjet. When users click on the verification URL in the email, they are redirected back to our application but encounter a 500 server error.
  - **Impact**: This issue prevents users from completing the email verification process, which is critical for activating their accounts.
  - **Workaround**: Registration through social apps (e.g., Google, Facebook) works as expected and does not encounter this issue.
  - **Current Status**: Unresolved. I'm investigating the root cause of the 500 server error and working towards a solution.
  - **Steps to Reproduce**:
    1. Register a new user account with an email address.
    2. Receive the email verification email from Mailjet.
    3. Click the verification URL in the email.
    4. Observe the 500 server error upon redirection back to the application.
  - **Additional Notes**: We have verified that the Mailjet configuration is correct and are currently debugging the application's email verification handler to resolve this issue.

"Budget Explorer" is designed to be a user-centric application that not only helps users find affordable places to visit but also fosters a community where users can share their experiences and tips. By following the outlined features and implementation details using Django and TypeScript.

**Happy coding!**
