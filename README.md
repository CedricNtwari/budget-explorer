## Project Overview

Budget Explorer aims to help users discover affordable places based on their specific budget and location. Insp The application provides an interactive map, user reviews, and the ability to save favorite places. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, adhering to modern UX design principles.

This project was inspired by my wifeâ€™s experience during her first days after moving to Switzerland. She faced the challenge of browsing the internet to find budget-friendly places to visit. Budget Explorer aims to alleviate this struggle for anyone moving to a new country or simply looking to explore their surroundings on a budget. We hope it helps users connect with their new environment and find joy in discovering affordable adventures.
